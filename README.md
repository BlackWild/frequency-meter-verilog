# What is this?
Its a university project for "Logic Circuits" course.
We had to design a circuit that measures frequency of an input signal by Verilog language to be implemented on FPGA board.

### How to use this?
First take a look at project manual on [/Manual](/Manual) directory.
Its a list of projects to choose and we choose project #11.

> Note: Manual is in Persian language not English (sorry!)

Then check out my suggested circuit [freqMeter.v](freqMeter.v) . I tried to document the code in itself by comments,
hope its more readable.

There is also a [pins.ucf](pins.ucf) file that is written for our FPGA board and you should change it for yours
if you want to implement it on a board.
